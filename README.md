# `kong`

`kong` (stylised as a CLI command) is a command-line tool to bootstrap project files and folders. It was initially intended to replace [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) because it was running slowly, and was structured in a way I wasn't fond of, but I decided to rewrite and publish it. It will be one of my major ongoing projects.

## Usage

Usage will come when I've built a working version.
